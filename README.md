"EEC172: Embeded System - Final Project" 

I have been diving into this project lately, and let me tell you, the Automatic Garage Door Opener is a real gem. I have put together a setup that's pretty slick, using the TI Launchpad CC3200 for Wi-Fi connectivity. With that, I am able to process signals from the IR receiver, and I have got the Arduino Uno R3 in there too, handling the stepper motor for smooth and precise door movement.

It is all controlled with a AT&T IR remote control and an IR receiver circuit, but here's where it gets cool - I have added an OLED display to the mix. 

But wait, there is more! I have integrated this whole setup with AWS, so now I get real-time notifications straight to my phone. It's all about convenience and security, and man, let me tell you, it has been a game-changer for my garage setup.
