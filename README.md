Automatic Garage Door Opener
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Automatic Garage Door Opener project! Let me tell you a bit about what we've built.

Overview
This project is all about making your life easier and your home smarter. We've created a system that seamlessly controls your garage door, combining cutting-edge technology with user-friendly design.

Features
TI Launchpad CC3200: This little powerhouse handles Wi-Fi connectivity like a champ. It's the brain of our operation, processing signals from the IR receiver and coordinating everything with precision.

Arduino Uno R3: Meet the muscle behind the scenes. The Arduino Uno R3 works hand in hand with the CC3200 to control the stepper motor, ensuring your garage door moves smoothly and accurately every time.

IR Remote Control: With an AT&T IR remote control, operating your garage door is as easy as pressing a button. The IR receiver circuit picks up the signals and communicates with the rest of the system to get things moving.

OLED Display: Ever wished your garage door could greet you with a friendly message? Our system does just that! The OLED display not only welcomes you home but also keeps you updated on your door's status.

AWS Integration: We've taken things a step further by integrating our system with AWS. This means you'll receive real-time notifications on your phone, keeping you in the loop and giving you peace of mind, no matter where you are.
