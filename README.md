# Welcome to My Automatic Garage Door Opener Project!

Greetings! I'm thrilled to introduce you to my latest project, the Automatic Garage Door Opener. Allow me to walk you through the wonderful features and functionality I've crafted.

## Overview

In this endeavor, I've poured my heart into creating a system that not only opens and closes your garage door but does so with elegance and efficiency. Here's a glimpse into what I've accomplished:

## Features

- **TI Launchpad CC3200**: With the TI Launchpad CC3200 at the helm, I've ensured seamless Wi-Fi connectivity and precise signal processing from the IR receiver.

- **Arduino Uno R3**: Working hand in hand with the CC3200, the Arduino Uno R3 controls the stepper motor, guaranteeing smooth and accurate door movement.

- **IR Remote Control**: Thanks to an AT&T IR remote control, operating your garage door is as simple as pressing a button. The IR receiver circuit picks up these signals flawlessly.

- **OLED Display**: I've incorporated an OLED display to greet you with welcoming messages and provide real-time updates on your door's status.

- **AWS Integration**: For added convenience and security, my system integrates seamlessly with AWS, ensuring I receive timely notifications on my phone.

## Getting Started

To bring this innovation to my garage, here's what I need to do:

1. **Set Up the Hardware**: Gather your TI Launchpad CC3200, Arduino Uno R3, IR remote control, and all the other components listed in my finalized BOM.

2. **Connect Everything**: Follow my detailed instructions to wire up your system and establish communication between the devices.

3. **Install the Software**: Download the code from my GitHub repository and upload it to your devices to bring them to life.

4. **Enjoy the Benefits!**: Sit back, relax, and bask in the convenience of your new Automatic Garage Door Opener. Say farewell to manual door operation forever!
